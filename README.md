# PE-File-Analysis-Thesis

Created by B00132407

This repository contains all the additional files related to the thesis completed by Thomas Bowe.

1.	Python Scripts: These were the scripts used to generate the hash of each section of the PE File.

2.	Output Hashes: These were the output files that contained the hashes for each section of the pe file for each malware family.
   
3.  Sample Files: These were the names of the sample files, they were grouped by the family they were related to. Only the names of the files were stored as these were malicious .exe files that could not be uploaded anywhere.

4.	Excel Files: These were the files in which the findings were documented in. These were used to create graphs from the results found in the experimentation phase.
